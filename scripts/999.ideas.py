# Get goals against features and points of opponents features
# If these show good improvement then look at other features too
# make sure to test these in model with and without the odds
# try different explanatory variable (i.e. based on error of the odds - again with and without odds)

# Do random samples of, say, 200 and bootstrap to test volatility of returns
# Compare this to model output to see if model is any better
# Plot chart of increasing 'probability cushion' and see if behaviour is generally as expected
# Do several similar models and see if outputs suggest to bet on the same games
# Above should give some indication of whether an ensemble of models would be better

# train several models and use ensemble
# e.g. a h,d,a model and just a h model
